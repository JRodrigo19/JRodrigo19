# Hi there, I'm JRodrigo19 👋

I'm currently transitioning my career to **Cybersecurity** and constantly improving my skills in the **Information Security** field.

- Hands-on learning with **SIEM** tools, monitoring, detection, and incident response.
- Build projects that simulate real-world security environments.
- Strengthen skills in operating systems (Linux, Windows) and networking tools (pfSense, Wazuh).
